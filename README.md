# SocketChat

A very basic chat application written in pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript only using socket.io.

## Prompt

> Create a real-time chat application using node. Everything else is allowed (for example clients connecting via command line or via an html page ...) Suggestion for people who're not sure how to start: use socket.io (their tutorial is a chat application). 2 bonus points will be given: 1 to the submission with best / most beautiful layout and 1 to the submission with the coolest extra features.

## Live version

Check a live instance of this project [here](https://jakcharvat-socket-chat.herokuapp.com).

> :warning: Note: This is deployed as a server on Heroku. I only have a free Heroku account, so it will go to sleep after a while. This will clear the data, and will take a while to boot back up. You can also just run the server locally.



## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/jakcharvat/SocketChat
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd SocketChat
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```
